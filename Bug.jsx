In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating using the `useNavigate` hook within a component that hasn't fully mounted.  This typically occurs when the component's state isn't ready or data fetching hasn't completed before attempting navigation.  The error might not be immediately apparent; instead, the navigation might simply fail silently, leaving the user stranded on the current page.
